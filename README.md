# Ham

## Synopsis

This script deploys an OpenStack on Grid'5000 using
[Kolla](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kolla) and allows easy
customization of the system (change in the default topology,
configuration parameters) and reproductible experiments.

## Installation

To install Ham, first connect to the Grid'5000 frontend of your
choice and run.

```
pip install git+git://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/ham@master#egg=ham
```

## Configuration

To deploy a full stack, you need to provide a configuration file in the YAML
format. This file must include information about the Grid'5000 job and how the
OpenStack services must be deployed. `reservation.yaml.sample` is given as an
example.

```
# copy the sample file
cp reservation.yaml.sample reservation.yaml

#edit it with your parameters
<editor> reservation.yaml
```

## Note on Registry backends

The deployment makes use of a private docker registry configured as a
mirror of the official docker registry. There are two modes
* `ceph: false`. It will start a fresh registry that will cache the
  images for the duration of the experiment.
* `ceph: true`. It will use an existing Ceph rados block device of the
  Rennes cluster.
The block device will be mounted and used as the registry storage. Setting this
is usefull as the cache will persist different experiments.

[The G5k ceph tutorial ](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Ceph) will
guide you on how to create your rados block device.


## Deploying

Then, to launch the deployment:
```
ham deploy
```

> by default the script use the file `reservation.yaml` as configuration file

This will run the following phases:

* `up`: reserve physical machine on Grid'5000, deploys the base linux
  distribution, instruments nodes with the monitoring stack, installs
  Kolla prerequisites (runtime dependencies, input files).

* `os`: launch the OpenStack deployment with Kolla

* `init`: bootstrap the freshly deployed OpenStack with users,
  images...


> Run `ham --help` for a full list of command-line arguments.

After the execution, the `./current` directory will contain some
generated files (please note that `current` is a symbolic link toward
the real directory associated to your deployment) and the results of
the benchmarks.


## Contribute

```
git clone https://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/ham
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
cd ham
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```
Make sure to add ansible binaries to your PATH (export
PATH=YOUR_HOME/.local/bin:$PATH).

Finally, to launch the deployment, run:
```
python -m ham.ham deploy
```

And, to command line arguments:
```
python -m ham.ham -h
```

> Using a virtualenv is encouraged


## Launch rally benchmarks

You can launch a rally benchmark using:

```
ham bench --scenarios=<scenario file>
```

Ansible will connect to the node(s) hosting Rally service and launch
in sequence all the benchmarks described in the scenario file.

> The scenario file must resides in the rally subdirectory.


## Post-mortem analysis

At the end of the benchmarks, various datas (logs, influxdb, rally home
directory, ...) are stored under the `current` directory. This enables
post-mortem analysis of the experimentation.

Please refer to the `result` directory to know how to get started with
*post-mortem* analysis


## Example of customizations

### Changing Kolla / Ansible variables

Custom Kolla / Ansible parameters can be put in the configuration file
under the key `kolla`.

### Changing the topology

Let's assume you want to run the `nova-conductor` in a dedicated node:

1) Add a new node reservation in the configuration file:

```yaml
paravance:
  control: 1
  network: 1
  compute: 1
  conductor-node: 1
```

2) Create an new inventory file in the `inventories` subdirectory
(copy paste the sample inventory) and change the group of the
conductor service:

```
[nova-conductor:children]
conductor-node
```

3) In the configuration file, points the inventory to use to this new
inventory.

4) Launch the deployment as usual, and you'll get the `nova-conductor`
on a dedicated node.

### Configuration tuning

At some point, Kolla default parameters won't fit your needs. Kolla
provides a mechanism to override custom section of configuration files
but isn't applicable in our case (at least in the corresponding
branch). So we implement a *quick and dirty* way of patching Kolla
code to enable custom configuration files to be used (and by extension
custom kolla code). See the possible patch declaration in
`ansible/group_vars/all.yml`. Patches should be added in the
configuration file of the experiment.

## Known limitations

* There might be an issue if your reservation contains multiple Grid'5000
  clusters composed of nodes that have different network device names, e.g.
  paravance that has `eth0` andl `eth1`, and parapluie that has devices `eth1`
  and `eth2`.
